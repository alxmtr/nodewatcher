# nodewatcher

A simple Node.js watcher that automatically reloads a script on changes.

### Usage
`node watcher.js your_script.js`

### ⚠️ Archived Repository
This tool was made as an experiment when I started to work with Node.js years ago.

I recommend using existing tools such as [Nodemon][nodemon-website] which is suitable and provides more features.

Also, [Node.js 19][node-19] adds a `node --watch` CLI option to run a script in "watch" mode without having to install any package.
